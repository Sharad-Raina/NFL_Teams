The National Football League (NFL) attracts millions of fans to its matches each week, making attendance prediction a crucial aspect for stadium management and team performance evaluation. In this study, I've utilized linear regression and random forest models to predict weekly attendance at NFL matches based on various factors.

Methodology:
Data Collection: Historical data on NFL matches, including game statistics, team performance, weather conditions, and ticket prices, were collected from reliable sources.

Data Preprocessing: The collected data underwent preprocessing steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to ensure compatibility with the predictive models.

Model Building:
Linear Regression: We employed linear regression to establish a baseline model for attendance prediction. This model aimed to capture the linear relationship between independent variables and weekly attendance.
Random Forest: In addition to linear regression, we utilized a random forest model to explore non-linear relationships and interactions among predictors. Random forest is a robust ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
Model Evaluation: The performance of both models was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R^2) to assess their predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities.

The results indicate that both models can effectively predict weekly attendance at NFL matches, with the random forest model performing slightly better than linear regression. Factors such as team names,team performance, game importance, weather conditions, and ticket prices were found to significantly influence attendance patterns. The insights gained from this study can inform stadium management strategies, marketing campaigns, and ticket pricing decisions to optimize attendance and enhance fan experiences at NFL matches.
